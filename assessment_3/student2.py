# Answer to the Question:
"""
For the pre-processing, we remove illegal characters using python standard
libraries re, then we select some high-freq stopWords and convert 1-5 numbers
into english words. Lastly, we apply stopWords and remove punctuations using
python standard library string. For postprocessing, we don't think any
processing steps is required. We choose word dimension of 300, we found that
word dimension 200 and 300 are both good values as a network input dimension.

We eventually decided to do regression. Before that we also implement a version
of classification and found regression is slightly better than classification
with other parameters the same. For regression, there is no need to do more in
convertLabel since label themselves are float values. However, something should
be done in convertNetOutput. Regression's output can be any float and may
exceed the range [1.0, 5.0], so we should clamp them into range [1.0, 5.0] and
use torch.round().

For network structure, we use LSTM -> linear1 -> relu -> linear2 -> output. We
use bidirectional LSTM with dropout rate 0.5 in case of over-fitting. 0.5 is a
good value after several attempts. In terms of loss function, we firstly tried
MSE and MAE, which are common loss functions for regression questions but they
didn't perform well here. We then implemented our own loss function, we call it
'weighted MAE'. We give the network different reward (different weights) about
correct and one-star away items, 0.2 and 0.98 respectively. Compared with
reward weight 0.2 and 0.98, adding the loss by 15 is a penalty which punishes
two, three or four star away prediction items.

We made changes to training hyper-parameters as well. We use trainValSplit
ratio 0.99 instead of default value 0.8 simply because we want more data to be
trained. Moreover, we use Adam as optimizer other than SGD since we found Adam
is better at converging the loss with a smaller learning rate 0.005. We also
increase the batch size to 128 to prevent local minima. The epoch is left as
default.
