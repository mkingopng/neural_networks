# Weekly overview

This week, we will explore the use of neural networks for sequence and language 
processing. Simple Recurrent Networks (SRN) can be trained to recognize or 
predict formal languages, and we can analyse their hidden unit dynamics. By 
the use of a gating mechanism, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated 
Recurrent Networks (GRU) are able to learn longer range dependencies than SRN. 
We look at the statistics of language, and show how word vectors can be 
assigned in a systematic way using approximations to singular value 
decomposition such as `word2vec` and `GloVe`.

# Weekly learning outcomes
- Design and run neural networks for processing temporal sequences.
- Describe different architectures including sliding windows, simple recurrent 
networks, long-short term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent units (GRU).
- Analyse hidden unit dynamics.
- Describe the methods for assigning word vectors and language processing

# Week 4 Purpose

# Activity Instructions
Open the Ed Lesson for Week 4 (access Ed using the yellow button below).
The Ed Lesson is a self-paced activity that will step you through content.

As you progress through the lesson, you will see green ticks that indicate what 
you have completed in the lesson. This will help you navigate as you exit and 
re-enter the lesson as time permits.

Complete the exercises (both non-coding and coding) in Ed to help you check 
your understanding and prepare for your assessments.
